# CyborgAudioToolkit
This is a Pd-based suite of effects for creating cyborg sounds

## Usage
Load ServoTest.pd into Pure Data (https://puredata.info/) and use the sliders to manipulate the various cyborg effects. More advanced users can map these controls to MIDI or put down additional instances of any effects.

## Included effects (Parts):
* Servo - This is a high-toned electric servo. More servo models are planned (e.g., heavier). The servo has an outlet which sends a bang when the servo motor enages or hits bottom. It is recommended that this is hooked to something like the Switch part
* Switch - A metallic clicking plus thump or zap sound (depending on slider positions)
* Fan - An electric fan effect.
* Breathing - A cyborg breathing effect. This differs from the fan in that the airway is narrower and also has a tube-like effect which can be engaged (tube in the breathing sense; not synonymous with valve)
* Frying - A simple circuits frying effect

If you find this useful, all I ask is a mention somewhere if you release a production with it.
More effects soon!
